                <p>DESIGNING A CULTURE OF DESIGN</p>
                <p>Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, and it doesn’t end
                    with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It’s the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs, and the
                    motivations that enable good work to get done, or it’s what stifles a workforce. For design to be
                    most effective and for designers to feel valued, we need to work in a culture that embraces design
                    and allows it to succeed</p>
                <p>
                    In Aaron’s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that *get* design,
                    both large and small. He will share what those teams, departments, and companies have that others
                    don’t, and more importantly, how to begin to change your own workplace’s culture. Once you’ve worked
                    within a culture of design it’s almost impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.
